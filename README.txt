========================   PROJECT OVERVIEW ================================

 This program uses block-encryption algorithm based on Twofish and Skipjack that 
 uses using a 64 bit block size and a 64 bit key. 
 We have a 2 input files: 
 	standard ASCII text file(plaintext.txt)
 	randomly chosen secret key(key.txt)
 and make 1 Output file: 
	HEX text file (call the file cyphertext.txt) which is the encryption of the input file

============================  FILES ===================================

Need 1 of the following files:
		
	plaintext.txt
	cyphertext.txt

Important file:

	key.txt
	wsucrypts.py

============================= RUN =======================================

Since using python there is no compiling needed. 

$ python3 wsucrypts.py

Output: 
	========= Welcome to the WSU-Crypt program ===============

	You can either encrypt by pressing 'e' or decrypt by pressing 'd'

	Encrypting or decrypting [e/d]:
	e or d

	========= Encrypting =========      or    =========== Decrypting ==============  or  Invalid Entry!!! Exiting..... Please try again later

	Writing Encrypted Ciphertext to cyphertext.txt  or Writing Decrypted Plaintex to plaintext.txt

	============ DONE ==========



======= Support Debug/Verbose mode ==========
These modes will show more information.
